Tweaking slicer settings can be a game-changer.
üîç By setting multi-select to "off" in both the quarter and year slicers, I can easily compare specific periods. For instance, if I want to analyze Netflix's performance in 2019 and compare it to 2023, I simply select both 2019 and 2023 at the same time.
üöÄ This approach empowers me to gain deeper insights and make more informed decisions.
üí° So, what basically multi-select "off" does is. It enables us to choose more than one option from a single slicer which can be helpful in many ways to analyze the data.
Of course, it's all about tailoring the analysis to meet the client's unique needs, preferences and basically, it's the end call from the client only if they need such preferences or not.
üîëIn the world of data, small adjustments can lead to big insights. So this I have explained in my project. Attached a video of it in add file section
